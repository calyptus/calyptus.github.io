For the <a href="/seb/2011/09/csspathanimation/">conversion tool from SVG path to CSS animations</a> I needed a selector for vendor prefixes. I decided to use the browser's logos.

High resolution and vector versions are readily available for all the browser logos. Unfortunately they don't look very good in small icons. They're also very colorful which tend to attract the eye of the user. Especially in a simple design.

I couldn't find any simplified versions of the logos so I decided to roll my own. You're welcome to use it if you want.

Here's the result:

<a href="/post-content/browser-logos.svg"><img class="alignnone" title="Browser Logos" src="/post-content/browser-logos.png" alt="" width="344" height="61" /></a>

<a href="/post-content/browser-logos.svg">Download browser-logos.svg</a>
